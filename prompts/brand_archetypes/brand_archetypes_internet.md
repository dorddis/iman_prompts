Brand Archetypes: The Definitive Guide
There’s just something about the brands we connect with. We have an affinity with them that’s hard to put your finger on. It’s as if we know them. In some cases, it’s as if we love them. What is it that attracts us to these brands? Why do we welcome them into our family or show loyalty towards them? Is it awesome Ad copy, amazing brand identity design or some kind of trickery?

The answer? Brand Archetypes.

In this article, we’re going to show you how you can use them to hack the mind of your audience to create enduring connections.

How The Brand Archetype Framework Builds Emotive Brands
Although all brands are businesses that we have a transactional relationship with, for some brands, we feel connection, loyalty and in some cases love. The most loved brands connect with their audience on a deeper level than most brands and those with an authentic brand purpose often capture hearts.

Almost all brands that you feel such a bond with are built with a solid alignment to an archetype, which are grounded in decades of psychological research and have their roots in Greek Mythology. Psychologist Carl Jung who coined the term in the early 20th century was in good company.

How Human Emotion Gave Birth To The Archetype
We all have basic human desires. We aren’t taught to want or need them. We just do. They are instinctive and primitive.

Here are the basic human desires that each match with a specific archetype:

LIBERATION > THE OUTLAW

POWER > THE MAGICIAN

MASTERY > THE HERO

INTIMACY > THE LOVER

ENJOYMENT > THE JESTER

BELONGING > THE EVERYMAN

SERVICE > THE CAREGIVER

CONTROL > THE RULER

INNOVATION > THE CREATOR

SAFETY > THE INNOCENT

UNDERSTANDING > THE SAGE

FREEDOM > THE EXPLORER

As we are all different, our desires are different. When we consider that certain behaviours or personalities increase certain desires, we can understand why some personalities appeal to us more than others.

Archetypes are the personification of these behaviours and provide a roadmap that enables you to more accurately appeal to a given desire with a specific personality.

There are two primary reasons you would want to align your brand with an archetype:

Connection: Most brands today are competing on features, benefits and price. If you don’t want your brand to become a commodity, you will need to make a deeper connection with your audience.

Differentiation: Personalities have infinite possibilities. They’re not only unique but can be extremely memorable.

This Is Why Archetypes Are So Unbelievably Effective
Through the use of story, art, religion, myths, Archetypes characterise universal templates of behaviour that we all instinctively understand. Whether it’s your funny uncle acting like The Jester or your anti-establishment friend dropping conspiracy theories as The Outlaw, you will see these archetypal personalities time and again.

Because the understanding of these archetypes is instinctive, we are able to connect with (or avoid) others very quickly when we experience them. Because this recognition is pre-programmed into our brains, they are an extremely useful tool when defining the position of your brand and the personality traits that will resonate with your intended audience.

Archetypes Have A Rich History
Plato (348 B.C.) explored the idea of archetypes when he spoke of “forms of intuition” as the templates of intuitive understanding.

Swiss Psychiatrist Carl Jung coined the term “Archetypes” in the context of personality. He said we all have a “collective unconscious” that channel experiences and emotions, resulting in typical templates of behaviour. In other words, we are born with the same instincts and unconscious understanding of behavioural templates.

In their 2001 book “The Hero and the Outlaw: Building Extraordinary Brands Through the Power of Archetypes”, Margaret Mark and Carol S. Pearson state that; “Archetypes are the heartbeat of a brand because they convey a meaning that makes customers relate to a product as if it actually were alive in some way, they have a relationship with it and care about it.”

There’s A 95% Probability That A Brand Archetype Has Seduced You
According to Harvard Professor Gerald Zaltman, a whopping 95% of our purchasing decisions are made in the subconscious mind. This means that brands with a strong archetypal personality that connects on an emotional level with their audience, have a massive advantage over their competition.

My Name is Maximus Decimus Meridius … And I’m an Archetype!
Long before branding and marketing experts got their mitts on archetypes, storytellers and filmmakers had been using archetypal characters.

Examples:

The exploits of Indiana Jones as The Explorer.

The guiding wisdom of Yoda as The Sage in Star Wars.

The rising from the ashes conquest of Maximus as The Hero in Gladiator.

All of these much-loved characters are built on archetypal foundations because storytellers knew about your intuitive instinct to connect with them quickly.

The Brand Archetype Strategy Goes Beyond Selecting Characteristics
If you want your audience to know who you are as a brand, your brand needs to know who it is. Aligning your brand as tightly as possible to a single archetype will allow your brand personality feel all the more familiar to your audience and allow you to communicate with the consistency and humanity of a real person.

Brand Archetypes Are Not About Appealing To Everyone
As the old adage goes “If you try to please everyone, you’ll end up pleasing no one”. An analysis referenced in "The Hero and The Outlaw" uncovered that brands with “tightly defined” archetypal identities rose in value by 97% more over six years than “confused brands”.

The moral of the story? Know who you are, know who your audience is and don’t try to please everyone.

Hang On…Who is the Archetype? My Customer or my Brand?
As archetypes represent all personalities then they are both your customer and your brand. The trick is to identify your customer’s personality, then align your brand with the archetype that would most appeal to a desire within your customer (They are often the same but not always).

Here Are The 12 Brand Archetypes
The Outlaw Archetype
Personality: The Outlaw has a desire for revolution. They have a disdain for rules, regulation and conformity. They are good at the core but anger is part of their motivation. Without a fight, they are lost.

Branding Strategy: To appeal to an outlaw, show them you see the world as they do. Status Quo and Conformity are the common enemy. Encouraging, facilitating or empowering revolution will resonate. Formal communication should be avoided; language should be laced with grit and attitude.

Archetype Branding is Chess, Not Checkers… A Differentiation Strategy Is Key
Your industry will often have a typical personality that your audience would expect (e.g., The Caregiver for healthcare). This is where the Archetypal Mix comes in.

You need a core archetype that will represent a minimum of 70% of your brand personality.

The other 30% is your influencer archetype, which is used for differentiation.

If you can go against the grain of your industry with your core archetype, you have an opportunity to make some real noise.

When The Outlaw Became The Creator
It’s possible for a brand to evolve from one archetype to another. Apple is a perfect example.

The Outlaw: In 1984, Apple came to the market with their anti-regime “1984” ad, positioning themselves as The Outlaw against the "Ruler" brand, Microsoft. The "I'm a Mac vs I'm a PC" campaign continued this.

The Creator: In 1997, the “Think Different” campaign celebrated creative geniuses. Apple aligned themselves with creatives, encouraging their audience to “Change the World” through creativity, and providing a tool for self-expression. They became a “Creator” brand.

Archetypes Are Masters At Evoking Your Desires
Archetypes in branding are not simply about mirroring the personality of your audience. It’s about identifying the desire that you want your brand to evoke and using that desire to define your personality.

Common positional approaches:

We are the same: Reassures your audience, providing a sense of belonging.

You can be me: Represents what your audience aspires to be.

I can guide you: Represents safety and trustworthiness.

You can be great: Inspires your audience to believe in themselves.

Great, But How Do I Apply This To My Brand?
Using the characteristics of your brand archetype, define its opinions on issues related to your market.

Using keywords, identify its attitude towards life.

Adopt a tone of voice and writing style that captures these opinions and attitudes.

Identify the vocabulary that your brand will use.

Expand your vocabulary with synonyms and capture this in your brand guidelines.

Adapt your brand visuals, colours, typography and images to represent this personality.

Apply your vocabulary, opinions, attitudes and tone of voice to all of your brand communication.

The more detail there is in your brand personality, the more vivid and memorable it will be.

Once Your Character is Defined… Your Story Begins
Once you have an archetype, you have the foundation and character for a brand story. Science shows we are 22 times more likely to remember a story than a fact. People don’t want information; they want to be taken on a journey.

As you develop your archetypal brand character, you can begin to weave a story around it.

Where did it come from?

Where is it going?

What will happen along the way?

Conclusion
Brand archetypes are an underutilised tool, especially for smaller businesses. To connect on a human level, a brand needs a human personality. There’s no better way to develop a human personality than using an archetypal framework developed to evoke human desires.

Identify what it is you want your audience to feel, map the archetype that will appeal best, and develop a real personality to give your brand conviction. Brands that know where they’re going, inspire people to follow.
