THE 2-THE-REFRAMING-DEVICE STRUCTURE:
Core template: Before/after contrast with repetitive structure for emphasis
Impact: Creates identity transformation and emotional shift from limiting to empowering

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (182 chars):
"Stop saying you have to. Start saying you get to. That shift from obligation to opportunity changes everything. Watch your energy transform when tasks become privileges, not burdens."

Example 2 (234 chars):
"Stop saying you have to. Start saying you deserve to. That shift from obligation to opportunity changes everything. Watch how your energy transforms when you approach tasks as privileges, not burdens. Your mindset shapes your reality."

Example 3 (238 chars):
"Stop chasing perfect. Start embracing progress. Every small step forward beats standing still waiting for ideal conditions. That project you're postponing? Ship the 80% version today. Momentum creates excellence, not the other way around."

Example 4 (196 chars):
"Stop avoiding failure. Start collecting lessons. Every setback contains data you couldn't get any other way. The most successful people have the longest list of failures. They just learned faster."

Example 5 (218 chars):
"Stop waiting for motivation. Start building systems. Motivation is unreliable; habits are forever. Create routines that work when you don't feel like it. Success isn't about feeling ready. It's about showing up anyway."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Cognitive Dissonance: Creates tension between current and desired state
2. Identity Permission: Gives permission for identity upgrade  
3. Behavioral Substitution: Replaces negative template with positive alternative
4. Hope Injection: Shows better future is achievable
5. template Interruption: Disrupts automatic limiting thoughts

→ "Stop thinking you need permission. "The biggest mistake is thinking you need permission." Start taking action anyway."

- Extract the limiting vs empowering elements
- Transform into clear "Stop/Start" structure
- Include specific details from source content
- Make the contrast emotionally compelling
