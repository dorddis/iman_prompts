THE 3-THE-UNCOMFORTABLE-TRUTH STRUCTURE:
Core template: Bold harsh claim + supporting rationale that's undeniable
Impact: Creates cognitive dissonance that forces self-reflection and behavioral change

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, varied natural lengths):

Example 1 (183 chars):
"Nobody is coming to save you. You're the only one who truly knows your problems and can fix them. Stop waiting for rescue. Your life changes the moment you stop being your own victim."

Example 2 (233 chars):
"Nobody is coming to save you. Here's why: You're the only one who truly knows your problems and has the power to fix them. Waiting for rescue wastes years. The harsh truth? Your life changes the moment you stop being your own victim."

Example 3 (226 chars):
"Your comfort zone is killing your potential. Truth: Every breakthrough happens when you step into discomfort. Playing safe feels smart but costs everything. The life you want? It's hiding behind the thing that scares you most."

Example 4 (186 chars):
"Most people fail because they quit too early. Success happens right after most people give up. That impossible moment? That's not the end. It's the test. Pass it, and everything changes."

Example 5 (248 chars):
"You're avoiding the one thing that would change everything. Real talk: That scary next step is exactly where your growth lives. You know what it is. Stop pretending you don't. The cost of avoidance compounds daily. Face it now or regret it forever."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Cognitive Dissonance: Forces confrontation between current beliefs and harsh reality
2. Reality Shock: Breaks through delusion and self-deception templates
3. Responsibility Transfer: Shifts locus of control back to the individual
4. Loss Aversion: Shows what's being lost by avoiding the truth
5. Identity Confrontation: Challenges who they think they are vs who they could become
</template_template>

<thinking_process>
Before writing, analyze:
1. What harsh reality does {target_audience} need to confront?
2. What evidence makes this truth undeniable and specific?
3. How can I be direct without being cruel or discouraging?
4. What responsibility shift will this create for the reader?
5. How can {brand_archetype} voice deliver this truth constructively?
</thinking_process>

<content_handling>
FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use the EXACT quoted text as the harsh truth centerpiece
- Frame with "Here's the uncomfortable truth:" or similar
- Add context that amplifies the truth's impact
- Never soften or paraphrase the quoted text
Example: Quote "Most people never reach their potential"
→ "Here's the uncomfortable truth: 'Most people never reach their potential.' Because they're more committed to comfort than growth."

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract the harsh reality hidden within the topic
- Transform into direct, confrontational statement
- Support with specific evidence from source content
- Make it personally applicable to the audience
