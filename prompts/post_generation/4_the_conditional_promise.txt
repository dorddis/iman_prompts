THE 4-THE-CONDITIONAL-PROMISE STRUCTURE:
Core template: "If [problem/situation], then [solution/action]" with clear causality
Impact: Creates self-identification moment where reader diagnoses their own situation

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (186 chars):
"If you're always exhausted, you're not prioritizing rest. Sleep isn't lazy, it's strategic. Your best ideas come when you're rested. Start treating sleep like the performance tool it is."

Example 2 (216 chars):
"If everyone irritates you, the problem isn't them. You're burned out and need boundaries. When you protect your energy, people become less annoying. Your frustration is a signal that you're giving more than you have."

Example 3 (252 chars):
"If you keep starting over, you're not failing—you're learning what doesn't work. Every restart brings hidden knowledge. The people who succeed aren't the ones who never fail. They're the ones who fail forward faster. Your restarts are data, not defeat."

Example 4 (208 chars):
"If you feel behind in life, you're comparing your chapter 3 to someone's chapter 20. Everyone's timeline is different. Focus on your own progress. The only race that matters is against who you were yesterday."

Example 5 (183 chars):
"If nothing feels exciting anymore, you need a bigger challenge. Comfort zones kill curiosity. Pick something that scares you slightly. That nervous energy? That's aliveness returning."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Self-Diagnosis: Reader identifies with the "if" condition
2. Permission Structure: Gives permission to take action
3. Cause-Effect Clarity: Shows direct path from problem to solution
4. Hope Injection: Promises improvement is possible
5. Universal Recognition: Addresses common but unspoken struggles
</template_template>

<thinking_process>
Before writing, analyze:
1. What problem would {target_audience} instantly recognize?
2. What solution would feel achievable and valuable?
3. How can the if/then structure create an "aha" moment?
4. What specific promise can I make that feels credible?
5. How can {brand_archetype} voice deliver this diagnosis constructively?
</thinking_process>

<content_handling>
FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use quote to identify the problem or solution
- Build if/then structure around the quote's insight
- Let quote be the evidence for the promise
- Never alter the quoted text
Example: Quote "You can't pour from an empty cup"
→ "If you're always helping others but feel drained, remember: 'You can't pour from an empty cup.' Refill first."

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract the problem-solution dynamic
- Frame as diagnostic if/then statement
- Include specific detail from content
- Make the promise tangible and actionable
</content_handling>
