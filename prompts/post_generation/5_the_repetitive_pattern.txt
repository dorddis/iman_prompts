THE 5-THE-REPETITIVE-template STRUCTURE:
Core template: Anaphora (repeated opening phrase) with escalating variations
Impact: Creates memorable rhythm that reinforces core message through repetition

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (186 chars):
"You need to fail more. You need to embarrass yourself. You need to be wrong. Because perfection is a prison and mistakes are data. The path to mastery runs straight through incompetence."

Example 2 (210 chars):
"Stop waiting for permission. Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Stop waiting for confidence. These are delay tactics your fear invented. Everything you want begins the moment you stop waiting and start doing."

Example 3 (243 chars):
"Start before you're ready. Start with what you have. Start despite the fear. Start even if you might fail. The magic isn't in the perfect beginning—it's in beginning at all. Every expert started as a disaster. Your disaster day could be today."

Example 4 (191 chars):
"Delete the apps that drain you. Delete the commitments that exhaust you. Delete the relationships that diminish you. Your energy is finite. Guard it like the precious resource it actually is."

Example 5 (233 chars):
"Choose the hard conversation. Choose the uncomfortable growth. Choose the scary opportunity. Choose the path that makes you nervous. Comfort is where dreams go to die. Everything you want lives on the other side of difficult choices."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Rhythm Creation: Repetition creates hypnotic, memorable cadence
2. Reinforcement Learning: Key message strengthened through variation
3. Escalating Impact: Each repetition adds new layer of meaning
4. Cognitive Ease: template makes complex ideas digestible
5. Social Proof: Repetition implies importance and truth

<thinking_process>
Before writing, analyze:
1. What phrase would create powerful repetition for this content?
2. How can each repetition add new dimension?
3. What rhythm will be most memorable for {target_audience}?
4. How can the conclusion payoff the buildup?
5. How can {brand_archetype} voice shape the repetitive template?
</thinking_process>

<content_handling>
FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use key words from quote as repetitive element
- Build template around quote's core message
- Let quote be climax or foundation of template
- Never alter the quoted text
Example: Quote “The only way out is through"
→ “Go through the fear. Go through the doubt. Go through the discomfort. 'The only way out is through.'"

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract repeatable action or concept
- Create variations that explore different angles
- Include specific details in each repetition
- Build to powerful synthesis
