THE 6-THE-ENUMERATED-VALUE-PROPOSITION STRUCTURE:
Core template: Numbered list (3-5 items) + synthesis conclusion
Impact: Makes complex ideas digestible and shareable through clear organization

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (184 chars):
"3 signs you're growing: 1) Old situations feel different 2) You're saying no more often 3) Drama exhausts you now. Growth isn't always visible, but these shifts reveal you're evolving."

Example 2 (222 chars):
"4 habits of highly focused people: 1) They batch similar tasks together 2) They protect their mornings fiercely 3) They say no to good opportunities 4) They treat attention like currency. Focus is a practice, not a talent."

Example 3 (247 chars):
"5 truths about success nobody talks about: 1) It's lonelier than failure 2) It attracts fake friends 3) It demands constant reinvention 4) It never feels like enough 5) It's worth it anyway. Prepare for the real journey, not the Instagram version."

Example 4 (179 chars):
"3 ways to instantly improve any relationship: 1) Listen without planning your response 2) Apologize without adding 'but' 3) Appreciate without expecting returns. Simple. Powerful."

Example 5 (207 chars):
"4 signs it's time to quit: 1) Sunday dread ruins your weekend 2) You've stopped learning 3) Your values clash daily 4) You fantasize about exit strategies. Sometimes quitting is the bravest thing you can do."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Cognitive Chunking: Numbers help brain process information
2. Completeness Bias: People want to read all numbered items
3. Easy Scanning: Format perfect for quick consumption
4. Memory Hooks: Numbers aid recall and sharing
5. Authority Signal: Lists imply expertise and organization
</template_template>

<thinking_process>
Before writing, analyze:
1. What 3-5 key points from content create maximum value?
2. What number feels complete without overwhelming?
3. How can the synthesis conclusion tie items together?
4. What ordering creates best flow and impact?
5. How can {brand_archetype} voice shape the list presentation?
</thinking_process>

<content_handling>
FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use quote as one list item or conclusion
- Build numbered insights around quote's theme
- Let quote anchor or culminate the list
- Never alter the quoted text
Example: Quote “Success is a series of small wins"
→ “3 small wins that compound: 1) Daily learning 2) Consistent execution 3) Regular reflection. 'Success is a series of small wins.'"

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract 3-5 most valuable points
- Order for maximum impact (save best for last)
- Include specific details in each point
- Synthesize with powerful conclusion
</content_handling>
