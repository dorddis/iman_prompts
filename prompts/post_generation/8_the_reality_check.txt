THE 8-THE-REALITY-CHECK STRUCTURE:
Core template: Provocative truth + evidence/context + personal responsibility call
Impact: Creates urgency for self-reliance through confronting comfortable delusions

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (200 chars):
"Your excuses are all valid. And they're also why nothing changes. Life doesn't care about your reasons. Results don't negotiate with circumstances. Choose: comfortable excuses or uncomfortable growth."

Example 2 (220 chars):
"Nobody's thinking about your failures as much as you are. They're too busy worrying about their own. That embarrassing moment you replay? Everyone forgot it. Stop being the curator of your own shame museum. Move forward."

Example 3 (227 chars):
"You're not too old to start. Colonel Sanders was 62. Vera Wang was 40. Sam Walton was 44. The only expiration date is the one you accept. Your age isn't the problem—your belief about your age is. Start today or regret it at 80."

Example 4 (194 chars):
"The world doesn't owe you understanding. Your trauma is real, but using it as permanent excuse is a choice. Healing means taking responsibility for your future despite your past. Own your story."

Example 5 (205 chars):
"You're exactly where your choices led you. Not your circumstances. Not your luck. Your choices. The good news? You're one decision away from a completely different life. The power was always yours. Use it."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Reality Confrontation: Breaks through comfortable self-deceptions
2. Responsibility Transfer: Shifts locus of control back to individual
3. Urgency Creation: Makes inaction feel costlier than action
4. Empowerment Through Truth: Hard truths that ultimately liberate
5. template Breaking: Disrupts victim mentality cycles
6. Action Catalyst: Converts awareness into immediate action

FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use the EXACT quoted text as the reality check centerpiece
- Frame with "Reality:" or "Truth:" introduction
- Add call to action based on quote's message
- Never alter the quoted text
Example: Quote "Success is rented, never owned"
→ "Reality check: 'Success is rented, never owned.' And rent is due every day. Stop coasting on yesterday's wins."

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract the harsh but necessary truth
- Support with specific evidence or examples
- Include clear personal responsibility element
- End with empowering call to action
