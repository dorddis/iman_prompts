THE 9-THE-SOLUTION-BENEFIT-STACK STRUCTURE:
Core template: Problem identification + stacked benefits + simple solution reveal
Impact: Creates desire and momentum by showing what's possible before revealing how

PROVEN EXAMPLES (180-275 chars, showing natural variety):

Example 1 (201 chars):
"What happens when you wake up 30 min earlier: • Extra time for yourself • Better morning mood • Higher productivity • Less rushed days The secret? Put your alarm across the room. Movement beats snooze."

Example 2 (226 chars):
"Why top performers journal daily: • Clarity on priorities • Emotional processing • Better decision-making • Trackable progress • Reduced anxiety The method? Just 3 lines: what worked, what didn't, what's next. Takes 2 minutes."

Example 3 (240 chars):
"Benefits of saying no more often: • Protected energy • Clearer priorities • Stronger boundaries • More respect • Less resentment • Time for what matters The trick? "That sounds great but I can't commit right now." Simple. Polite. Effective."

Example 4 (184 chars):
"What reading 20 pages daily creates: • Expanded knowledge • Better focus • Improved vocabulary • Stress reduction The key? Read during your first coffee. Stack habits. Compound wisdom."

Example 5 (211 chars):
"Signs you're finally healing: • Old triggers feel smaller • You respond instead of react • Boundaries feel natural • Peace over drama The path? One honest conversation with yourself daily. Growth lives in truth."

PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANICS:
1. Benefit Stacking: Multiple rewards create overwhelming value
2. Curiosity Gap: Benefits create "how do I get this?" question
3. Simplicity Surprise: Complex benefits from simple action
4. Achievability Boost: Simple solution makes it feel doable
5. Social Proof: Implies others are already benefiting
6. Loss Aversion: Not doing it means missing all these benefits
</template_template>

<thinking_process>
Before writing, analyze:
1. What problem does {target_audience} want to solve?
2. What 3-4 benefits would they find most compelling?
3. What surprisingly simple solution addresses this?
4. How can benefits build desire before revealing method?
5. How can {brand_archetype} voice present this stack effectively?
</thinking_process>

<content_handling>
FOR QUOTES (content_type = "quote"):
- Use quote as the simple solution reveal
- Build benefit stack that the quote addresses
- Let quote be the "aha" moment
- Never alter the quoted text
Example: Quote "Small steps daily beat giant leaps"
→ "Benefits of tiny daily actions: • Less overwhelming • Sustainable progress • Compound results. The wisdom? "Small steps daily beat giant leaps."""

FOR TOPICS (content_type = "topic"):
- Extract core benefits from the topic
- Stack them for maximum impact
- Reveal simple implementation method
- Make complex topics feel achievable
</content_handling>
