SWEET SPOT TEMPLATES - Each serves different viral content strategies:

1. ONE-LINER DECLARATION: Bold imperatives that crystallize counterintuitive insights
   - Best for: Contrarian takes, wisdom nuggets, mindset shifts
   - Example result: "Normalize not having an opinion on things you don't understand. The smartest people say 'I don't know' regularly."

2. THE REFRAMING DEVICE: Shifts perspective from limiting to empowering mindsets
   - Best for: Mindset changes, alternative viewpoints, empowering alternatives
   - Example result: "Stop saying you have to. Start saying you get to. That shift from obligation to opportunity changes everything."

3. THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Difficult realities with empowering conclusions
   - Best for: Industry insights, hard truths, challenging assumptions
   - Example result: "The hardest part about building a business isn't the competition. It's staying motivated when progress feels invisible."

4. THE CONDITIONAL PROMISE: If/then structures with clear value propositions
   - Best for: Strategic advice, actionable insights, cause-effect relationships
   - Example result: "If you can stay consistent for 90 days, you'll outperform 90% of people who rely on motivation."

5. THE REPETITIVE template: Rhythmic repetition for emphasis and memorability
   - Best for: Lists, comparisons, building momentum, memorable frameworks
   - Example result: "Great leaders don't create followers. Great leaders create more leaders. Great leaders create legacy."

6. THE ENUMERATED VALUE PROPOSITION: Structured insights in numbered format
   - Best for: Actionable tips, frameworks, step-by-step insights
   - Example result: "3 signs you're ready to scale: 1) Consistent revenue 2) Systems that work without you 3) A team you trust"

7. THE PARADOXICAL COMMAND: Counterintuitive advice that makes sense upon reflection
   - Best for: Surprising insights, contrarian wisdom, thought-provoking takes
   - Example result: "To get more done, do less. Focus amplifies results. Distraction dilutes them."

8. THE REALITY CHECK: Grounding statements about actual market conditions
   - Best for: Industry insights, market analysis, practical wisdom
   - Example result: "95% of startups fail not because they lack great ideas, but because they solve problems no one actually has."

9. THE SOLUTION-BENEFIT STACK: Problem → Solution → Clear outcome progression
   - Best for: Strategic advice, overcoming challenges, clear value propositions
   - Example result: "Stuck in analysis paralysis? Set a decision deadline. You'll make better choices under gentle pressure than endless deliberation."
