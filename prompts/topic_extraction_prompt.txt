</context>

<segment>
{segment_content}
</segment>

<task>
Extract 2-4 specific, insightful highlights from the podcast segment above that would be valuable and engaging content.

First, analyze the segment step-by-step:
1. Review any provided segment hints as starting insights
2. Identify additional main themes and key points not yet captured
3. Consider what would broadly appeal to people, with {target_audience} as the primary but not exclusive audience
4. Look for insights that could connect with or benefit the target audience in some way, even if not directly
5. Evaluate alignment with the {brand_archetype} brand voice
6. Select the most compelling insights, enhanced by any available hints

Then extract topics following these requirements.
</task>

<requirements>
EXTRACTION CRITERIA:
- Focus on actionable insights, memorable quotes, and unique perspectives that have broad appeal
- Build upon any provided segment hints while discovering new angles
- Extract both conceptual topics and direct quotable phrases
- Each item should stand alone as valuable content
- Prioritize insights that can connect with {target_audience}, but don't exclude valuable content that could benefit them indirectly
- Consider what would resonate with a "{brand_archetype}" brand voice
- Look for challenging ideas and flexible concepts that can be adapted by different audiences

QUOTE HANDLING:
When content_type is "quote":
- Use EXACT text from transcript (verbatim, no paraphrasing)
- Preserve original wording, punctuation, and style
- Include speaker attribution if available
- Mark clearly as content_type: "quote"
- Maximum quote length: 200 characters for Twitter compatibility

TOPIC HANDLING:
When content_type is "topic":
- Provide clear conceptual insight with supporting details
- Include specific examples or data points from the segment
- Make it actionable or thought-provoking
</requirements>

<scoring_rubric>
Assign relevance score 1-5 based on overall value and engagement potential, with {target_audience} as primary consideration using STRICT criteria:

Score 1 (Terrible): Generic, boring, or completely irrelevant
- Example: "Hard work pays off" (platitude everyone knows)
- Example: "Be yourself" (vague, unhelpful)

Score 2 (Poor): Somewhat relevant but weak, obvious, or unactionable  
- Example: "You should exercise regularly" (obvious, not specific)
- Example: "Communication is important" (true but not insightful)

Score 3 (Average): Decent content but not compelling or unique enough
- Example: "Focus on one task at a time" (decent but common advice)
- Example: "Start your day with intention" (okay but not memorable)

Score 4 (Good): Strong relevance, actionable, and genuinely valuable
- Example: "Write your three priorities before checking email" (specific, actionable)
- Example: "Replace 'I have to' with 'I get to' in your vocabulary" (unique reframe)

Score 5 (Excellent): Exceptional insight that's highly specific and will definitely engage
- Example: "Start meetings by stating the exact outcome needed in one sentence" (highly specific, immediately actionable)
- Example: "The 2-minute silence rule: pause 2 minutes before any major decision" (unique, specific, memorable)

BE HARSH - Most content should score 2-3. Reserve 4-5 for truly exceptional insights.

<validation_checklist>
Before outputting JSON, verify:
1. Have I leveraged any provided hints while finding new angles?
2. Have I identified the most valuable insights (not just the first ones I found)?
3. Are quotes EXACTLY as spoken (no paraphrasing)?
4. Are topics specific and actionable (not vague)?
5. Do scores honestly reflect quality (not inflated)?
6. Would the {brand_archetype} archetype share this content?
7. Will this genuinely interest {target_audience} or provide value that could connect with them in some way?
</validation_checklist>

<output_format>
Return ONLY a JSON array with 2-4 extracted topics/quotes:
[
  {{
    "topic_title": "The specific insight or concept title",
    "content_summary": "For quotes: EXACT verbatim text. For topics: Detailed explanation of the insight",
    "key_insights": "For topics: 2-3 specific, actionable takeaways or concrete points that readers can immediately understand and apply. For quotes: The same as content_summary.",
    "hook_elements": {{
      "contrarian_angle": "What counterintuitive truth or surprising perspective exists here (if any)",
      "specific_example": "Concrete story, case study, or real-world example mentioned (if any)",
      "memorable_quote": "Most impactful exact quote from the content (if different from content_summary)",
      "data_point": "Specific number, statistic, or measurable fact mentioned (if any)",
      "unique_metaphor": "Vivid comparison, analogy, or metaphor used (if any)"
    }},
    "relevance_score": 3,
    "content_type": "topic or quote"
  }}
]

Note: For hook_elements, only include values that actually exist in the content. Use empty strings "" for elements not present.
Key Insights should be concrete, actionable points that can be used directly in social media posts without requiring additional interpretation.
