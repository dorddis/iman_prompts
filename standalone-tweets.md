## Tweet 1: The Happiness Paradox
"I asked people at the absolute highest of their careers: 'Are you happy?'

Every single person said either 'I will be happy when...' or 'I would be happy if...'

They had attained everything yet were still an arm's length away from happiness.

Seeking happiness in success is like looking for milk in a shoe store - it's not there."

## Tweet 2: Mind Control Reality Check
"Imagine if your arms started flailing uncontrollably and you said 'don't worry, these are just my silly arms.'

You'd get help immediately.

But we let our minds roam into anger, jealousy, and misery and say 'oh, my silly mind.'

The mind is the steering wheel of your life. Master it or it masters you."

## Tweet 3: The Two Thought Questions
"When someone does something that triggers anger or hurt, ask yourself two questions:

1. 'Is there an alternative thought I could have?'
2. 'Is it worth it?'

Stop being a slave to what others do. Regain veto power over your own mind.

You choose which thought vehicles to board."

## Tweet 4: Success Without Identity Crisis
"Nothing wrong with chasing success in your 20s and 30s.

The problem: if you ARE that success, then when it doesn't come, you become 'I am a failure.'

This is why students jump from hostel buildings over failed exams.

You HAVE a career. You ARE consciousness."

## Tweet 5: The Fame Energy Vomit
"People literally vomit on us, and we shower immediately.

But people energetically vomit on us with projections, expectations, and social media comments.

We need spiritual showers too.

30 minutes of daily solitude isn't luxury - it's necessity for anyone in the public eye."

## Tweet 6: Forgiveness Formula
"We forgive not because what they did was okay.

We forgive because we deserve to be free.

If you don't forgive, you're saying: 'You harmed me once, now I'll give you the rest of my life.'

Why sacrifice your freedom on the altar of someone else's arrogance?"

## Tweet 7: The Virat Kohli Wisdom
"Virat Kohli just won the trophy he waited 20 years for.

His first words to his teammate: 'Go back home to your new baby. Go back to the real stuff.'

Here's a legend who spent two decades chasing this moment - and he calls family 'the real stuff.'

What does that tell you?"
